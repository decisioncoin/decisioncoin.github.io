# Token

DecisionCoin is an [ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20-token-standard.md) token that ensures the DecisionCoin network operates as intended.

Each solution is its own [decentralized autonomous organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) facilitated through smart contracts that define the business relationships.  

A solution consists of the following elements:
1 - Target metric


## Economic Incentives
Creating a healthy decisioning marketplace is critical. The marketplace needs to ensure two things:
- Data scientists get paid for breakthroughs
- The price of less novel solutions will approach the price of execution
- The market steadily gets smarter

Ideas:
* Each problem category accumulates a bounty based on its usage. This is presumably a fee integrated into pricing model. 
* Businesses place bids based on the economic value of improvements, not just model execution.
* One potential problem with second price auction is lack of scarcity. Maybe
* Fees are reduced or eliminated if you provide feedback (additional training & test data)
* Alternatively, we'll provide free tokens for training data in promising domains


## Advantages for businesses
* Better models from the community of data scientists 
* Continuous improvement
* One-time implementation. There is no friction between model build, evaluation, and deployment
* Decentralized market that ensures pricing is fair and reflects business value.
* Encryption to ensure commercial data stays safe

## How we make money

* Filecoin: Filecoin is a protocol, it doesn't "make money" any more than the Bitcoin protocol can make money. Filecoin is being built by Protocol Labs (a business), who makes money by holding Filecoin amongst other endeavors.
* Ethereum: gas usage
- Need to understand market norms?
* Take a fee (10%?) oon each transaction


### Coin Allocation:
* 40% - Bounties and 
* 30% - Team
* 10% - Marketing
* 10% - Admininstration & ICO process
* 5% - Contractors 
* 5% - Contingency 


### Examples:
- BAT (Basic Attention Token) 
$36 million in (156k Ether in 24 seconds) 
Budget allocation(58% team, 10% admin, 12% marketing, 13% contractors, 7% contingency)

* KIK
$50 million pre-sale @ 30% discount, $75 million public coin offering

* Numerai approach:
-- Numeraire ERC20 Token
-- Crowd-sourced models for predicting stock market performance. 
-- Modelers submit predictions of future performance, updating their probability weekly. 
-- Two tournaments: Basic Tournament and Staking tournament. 
--- Basic tournament: Anyone can submit a model and earn $ or Numeraire.
--- Staking tournamet: Modelers stake Numeraire and can earn dollars for good predictions. Destroyed when bad predictions. 
--- Auction process determines how much is staked (confidence of modeler)
-- Modelers are ranked based on their logarithmic loss and paid monthly (originally in BTC, now in Numeraire)
-- Pay based on "originality" of the model. If it's correlated with past submissions, not helpful.
-- Gave away 1 million to users as part of their ICO, total of 21 million

- Cloud computing / Computation markets (Golem, iExec, Truebit)
- Prediction: Augur / Gnosis
- Oracle systems: Oraclize, Augur
