# DecisionCoin is a decentralized network for making better decisions. 

Data scientists mine DecisionCoin by building *better predictive models*. 

Miners with available compute resources mine DecisionCoin by *evaluating models in real-time*.

Sponsors pay DecisionCoin to *deliver better models and evaluate their models in real-time*.


## DecisionCoin provides several advantages for sponsors:
* Continuously improving models that tap into the worldwide community of data scientists.
* One-time implementation. There is no friction between model build, evaluation, and deployment
* Decentralized market that ensures pricing is fair and reflects business value.
* End-to-end encryption to ensure 

## Data scientists also see several advantages:
* Get paid for their model building 
* Continue to get paid as long as their modela are used
* Access to a licensing channel that rewards model performance over sales skills


## The Market
Algorithmic decisioning (or the more buzzy "machine learning") is huge and will continue to grow. A few domain examples: 
 
* Banks want to estimate the probability that a borrower will default on a loan
* Airport security want to determine whether a passenger deserves additional screening
* Marketers want to estimate the likelihood a user will click on an ad
* Radiologists want to identify a tumor in a lung CT-scan
* Realtors want to predict home sale values
* Web publishers want to forecast web traffic to accurately assess demand
* and on and on. 

All of these categories support robust commercial solutions, but suffer from the same problem: it's difficult to determine which solution provides the best[1] solution. This is true for a couple of reasons:
1. Bad software sometimes has great salespeople, and vice-versa.
2. Testing the efficacy of a new solution against the status quo takes time, effort and expertise
3. Implementing a new solution in a production environment is difficult and time-consuming. 
 
DecisionCoin solves these problems through a consensus blockchain that maintains a record of the best[1](#1) solution for a variety of problems and a standardized API that makes it easy to run the most effective model in production at all times.   

[1]: Note that the best solution is often the most accurate, but may also include other considerations like cost, absence of false positives/negates, etc.
