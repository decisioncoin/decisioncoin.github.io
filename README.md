# DECIDE is a decentralized network for making better decisions. 

DECIDE solves real problems by connecting capital with the data scientists and data owners. We track and reward performance in an open and fair manner using our token DecisionCoin. 

* Data scientists earn DecisionCoin by building better predictive models. 
* Data owners earn DecisionCoin by providing unique data that improves performance. 
* Investors buy DecisionCoin to implement the models and earn a return.
