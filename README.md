DecisionCoin is a decentralized network for making automated decisions. 

Sponsors pay DecisionCoin to deliver better predictions and evaluate those models in real-time.

Data scientists mine DecisionCoin by building better predictive models. 

Miners with available compute resources mine DecisionCoin by evaluating models in real-time.

DecisionCoin provides several advantages for sponsors:

-Continuously improving models that tap into the worldwide community of data scientists.
-One-time implementation. There is no friction between model build, evaluation, and deployment
-Decentralized market that ensures pricing is fair and reflects business value.
-End-to-end encryption to ensure 

Data scientists also see several advantages:
-Get paid for their model building 
-Continue to get paid as long as their modela are used
-Access to a licensing channel that rewards model performance over sales skills
