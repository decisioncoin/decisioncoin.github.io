# DecisionCoin is a decentralized network for making better decisions. 

Businesses pay DecisionCoin to deliver better models and evaluate their models in real-time.

Data scientists earn DecisionCoin by building better predictive models. 

Miners with available compute resources mine DecisionCoin by evaluating models in real-time.

## Advantages for businesses:
* Better models from the community of data scientists 
* Continuous improvement
* One-time implementation. There is no friction between model build, evaluation, and deployment
* Decentralized market that ensures pricing is fair and reflects business value.
* Encryption to ensure commercial data stays safe

## Advantages for data scientists:
* Get paid for building performant models 
* Access to a licensing channel that rewards model performance over sales skills
* Continue to get paid as long as their models are used

## The Market

### Demand from Businesses
Algorithmic decisioning (or the more buzzy "machine learning") is huge and will continue to grow. A few domain examples: 
 
* Banks want to estimate the probability that a borrower will default on a loan
* Airport security want to determine whether a passenger deserves additional screening
* Marketers want to estimate the likelihood a user will click on an ad
* Radiologists want to identify a tumor in a lung CT-scan
* Subscription services want to predict which of their subscribers are at risk of churning
* Web publishers want to forecast web traffic to accurately assess demand
* Realtors want to predict home sale prices

Commercial solutions exist in each category but they suffer from the same problem: it's difficult to determine which solution provides the best[1] solution. This is true for a couple of reasons:
1. Bad software sometimes has great salespeople, and vice-versa.
2. Testing the efficacy of a new solution against the status quo takes time, effort and expertise
3. Implementing a new solution in a production environment is difficult and time-consuming. 
 
DecisionCoin solves these problems through a consensus blockchain that maintains a record of the best* solution for a variety of problems and a standardized API that makes it easy to run the most effective model in production at all times.   

*The best solution is often the most accurate, but may also include other considerations like cost, absence of false positives/negatives, etc.  

### Supply of Data scientists
Crowdsourcing predictive modeling is a proven model. There are a wide variety of strategies that can be applied to a given data set and it's very hard to know in advance what will work best. 

There is a large community of data scientists interested in solving hard problems for fun and profit. [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) (now owned by Google) hosts competitions that pay data scientists for better models and has attracted a large audience. From [Kaggle's Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaggle):
 
> Kaggle competitions regularly attract over a thousand teams and individuals. The Kaggle community is active and committed, with 4,000 forum posts per month and over 3,500 competition submissions per day. It also includes many of the world’s best-known researchers, including members of IBM Watson’s Jeopardy-winning team and the team working on Google’s DeepMind. Many of these researchers publish papers in peer-reviewed journals based on their performance in Kaggle competitions.

Numerai reports that 20,000+ data scientists that have participated in their crowd-sourced stock market predictions. 

### Distributed Data sets
Decisioning algorithms need training data to succeed. Large, clean data sets create network effects that ensure that the DecisionCoin network delivers the most highest performing algorithms and attracts the most talented data scientists.  

We will allocate DC to compensate data owners for contributing to an open data set. Data that creates the greatest performance increase will receive a larger protion of the available compensation.
