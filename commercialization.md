# Commercialization

## Launch something fast
We can stand out from the bullshit in the token universe by quickly launching at least one commercial proof-of-concept.

Define high-potential domains and prioritize
-Peer-to-peer lending provides data set & obvious economics

## Economic Incentives
Creating a healthy decisioning marketplace is critical. The marketplace needs to ensure two things:
1) Data scientists get paid for breakthroughs
2) The price of less novel solutions will approach the price of execution
3) The market steadily gets smarter

Ideas:
-Each problem category accumulates a bounty based on its usage. This is presumably a fee integrated into pricing model. 
-Sponsors place bids based on the economic value of improvements, not just model execution.
-One potential problem with second price auction is lack of scarcity. Maybe
-Fees are reduced if you provide feedback (additional training & test data)

## How we make money

Take a fee (10%?) oon each transaction
-Need to understand market norms.
