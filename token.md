# Token

## Economic Incentives
Creating a healthy decisioning marketplace is critical. The marketplace needs to ensure two things:
- Data scientists get paid for breakthroughs
- The price of less novel solutions will approach the price of execution
- The market steadily gets smarter

Ideas:
* Each problem category accumulates a bounty based on its usage. This is presumably a fee integrated into pricing model. 
* Businesses place bids based on the economic value of improvements, not just model execution.
* One potential problem with second price auction is lack of scarcity. Maybe
* Fees are reduced or eliminated if you provide feedback (additional training & test data)
* Alternatively, we'll provide free tokens for training data in promising domains


## How we make money

- Need to understand market norms?

* Take a fee (10%?) oon each transaction

* Filecoin(random reddit comment): Filecoin is a protocol, it doesn't "make money" any more than the Bitcoin protocol can make money. Filecoin is being built by Protocol Labs (a business), who makes money by holding Filecoin amongst other endeavors.
* How do VCs intend to exit? 

* Ethereum:

## Launch something fast
We can stand out from the bullshit in the token universe by quickly launching at least one commercial proof-of-concept.

Define high-potential domains and prioritize

- Peer-to-peer lending provides data set & clear economics

 
### Initial coin offering
Initial coin offerings present an attractive way to finance the development of the company and have attracted signficant attention. 

### Key Questions:
* Best practices re: accreditation / securities reg. 
* How to allocate coins
* How to stage fundraising (Pre-sale, public) How much of total to make available?
* What is required to successfully raise at each stage? 
* Need to determine: Use Coin or a Security Coin?
(Coin required to purchase service o (coin provides dividends to owner)?
* Security coin provide a pool of ownership for each

### Examples:
- BAT (Basic Attention Token) 
$36 million in (156k Ether in 24 seconds) 
Budget allocation(58% team, 10% admin, 12% marketing, 13% contractors, 7% contingency)

* KIK
$50 million pre-sale @ 30% discount, $75 million public coin offering

* Numerai approach:
-- Numeraire ERC20 Token
-- Crowd-sourced models for predicting stock market performance. 
-- Modelers submit predictions of future performance, updating their probability weekly. 
-- Two tournaments: Basic Tournament and Staking tournament. 
--- Basic tournament: Anyone can submit a model and earn $ or Numeraire.
--- Staking tournamet: Modelers stake Numeraire and can earn dollars for good predictions. Destroyed when bad predictions. 
--- Auction process determines how much is staked (confidence of modeler)
-- Modelers are ranked based on their logarithmic loss and paid monthly (originally in BTC, now in Numeraire)
-- Pay based on "originality" of the model. If it's correlated with past submissions, not helpful.
-- Gave away 1 million to users as part of their ICO, total of 21 million

- Cloud computing / Computation markets (Golem, iExec, Truebit)
- Prediction: Augur / Gnosis
- Oracle systems: Oraclize, Augur
